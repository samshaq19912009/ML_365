ROC curve:

receiver operating characteristic curve:

illustrates the performance of a binary classifier system as its discriminationthreshold is varied

True positive rate plotted against False positive rate

meaning:  the area under the curve (often referred to as simply the AUC, or AUROC) is equal to the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative one
